##########################

Included in this github repo is my final project for a Machine Learning
class taken at the University of Oklahoma in Fall 2020. The final project
was open ended, and I chose to create my first neural network in order
to attempt to replicate the success of the neural net employed in
Lam & Kipping 2018. This neural net is meant to predict the long time
orbital stability of planets orbiting a binary star system. This stability
criterion was well established by Holman & Wiegert 1999, but near the
critical orbit where planets begin to go unstable, there are 'islands' of
instability that are not well described by the original 1999 criterion.
Lam & Kipping utilized deep learning to map the parameter space near the
critical orbit.

I generated the training data using REBOUND, an off the shelf numerical
integrator that can be run in both Python and C. The shell used to run REBOUND
is found in 'training_set.sh'. I recommend that it is only run either on a network with a job scheduler (i.e., run with slurm) or run it on a cron job. However, I have also included the complete training set used by the neural net.

The python notebook 'neural_net_training.ipynb' contains all the code
used to train and to test the neural net. It uses tensorflow and keras.


Also included is the trained neural net by Lam & Kipping used to
test my own results. This is the file '6layer_48neuron.h5'. All of their work
can be found at github.com/CoolWorlds/orbital-stability and was referenced
heavily while I was taking this first step at using neural nets.

Finally, I include both a writeup of the final project ('writeup.pdf') and the slides used for my final talk ('talkslides.pdf').
